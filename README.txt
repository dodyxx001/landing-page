Hello Everybody! :)

This is my first simple webpage project.

Making-of this simple site was a part of The Odin Project learning course.
The goal was to create an index.html webpage and style it using HTML and CSS.
I was given a template (jpg pic) of how the webpage must look.
The info displayed on the page had to be chosen by ourselves. I chose a music-based theme,
because I play music as a hobby.

So all the basics about HTML and CSS that I learned until now, I used in the making-of
this webpage.

I hope you like it:)
